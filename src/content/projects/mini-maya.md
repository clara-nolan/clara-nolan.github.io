A 3D modeling tool built entirely with C++ and GLSL, featuring mesh operations like Catmull-Clark subdivision, triangulation, vertex deformation, and edge splitting. It can also export the current model to USD format. The program includes basic mesh skinning and deformation capabilities by importing skeletons.
