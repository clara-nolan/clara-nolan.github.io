Noticing the lack of diversity in hair styles and textures in animation and gaming, we set out to create a Hair Generator tool that allows for different levels of customization in renders. Specifically, users can "hairify" a mesh by uplopading a hardshell FBX mesh and then customize levels of curliness/kinkiness of hair.
